# House Price Prediction

This repository contains a Machine Learning (ML) project focused on predicting house prices. The project includes a user interface where users can input various parameters such as area, number of bedrooms (BHK), number of bathrooms, and location. Upon entering these details, users can then utilize the "Estimate Price" option to retrieve the estimated price based on the provided requirements.

## Usage

To utilize the house price prediction system:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

## Dataset
The house price prediction model is trained on a dataset containing information about various properties but few features are shortlisted for the better training and accuracy, including their area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, and corresponding prices. This dataset is used to train the machine learning model for predicting house prices.

## Model
The machine learning model utilized in this project is trained on the provided dataset using appropriate algorithms for regression tasks. The model is designed to predict house prices based on input features such as area, BHK, bathrooms, and location.
